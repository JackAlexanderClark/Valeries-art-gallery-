                    I grew up in Cheshire, later educated at Cheadle County Grammar for Girls, Cheshire. 
                    Grew up in the 60s - (not swinging--- but in the Industrious Northern suburbs!)
                    and my first work at 17 was in Textiles, art reproduction and Graphics
                    before becoming a Tech/ information Officer in the Civil Service for
                    many years.

          <div class="col-sm">
                <p>
                    Prior to that, ran a Country Inn with my husband, which
                    nestled in the slopes of the Malvern Hills, and was constantly inspired
                    there by the sheer beauty and musicality of the Shires.
                    And Art was always there for me, for myself and my own creative
                    efforts, but also with a burgeoning interest in Classical art, even around
                    the hard-working career and family days.

                    I am more or less self- taught, apart from my early Textile
                    Design reproduction days when I attended a course at the
                    Faculty of Technology Manchester for Graphics/Printing
                    processes but during my Worcestershire years I did work with
                    the Worcester/Severn tutor Watercolourist, Robin Holder.
                    My Style is eclectic and sometimes arbitrary but always
                    influenced by a Light source. I work in Oils, Acrylics and
                    Watercolours when painting Plein Air.
                    I like to sketch with charcoal and for quick compositions and
                    portrait, use Pastels.

                    Today I can reflect on my Westerley sojourn down ------from Cheshire,
                    and then being in the midst of the Three Jewel counties of
                    Worcestershire, Herefordshire and Shropshire. More recently, where
                    I live now, and sure to retire, ----- here in Dramatic Cornwall.
                    I have been inspired by the incredulous beauty of all these Shires of
                    Western England and they have influenced my sketchings and paintings
                    and I hope Cornwall will inspire even more. My collection is essentially
                    “the English Scene”.
